# Fork working with 0x7783 LCD devices

Added the hardware specific values from the SWIFT driver by Smoke And Wires
This works also for some Iduino 2.8'' displays

Now you can work with the Adafruit examples.

This library is only for the Arduino Uno


This is a library for the Adafruit 2.8" TFT display.
This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" TFT Breakout w/SD card

Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use 8-bit parallel to communicate, 12 or 13 pins are required
to interface (RST is optional).
